How to use this makefile? I wrote a simple step guide how to create an eclipse project for mbed, used FRDM-KL25Z board: [mbed GCC with eclipse for KL25Z](http://0xc0170.github.io/mbed/2013/08/05/mbed-gcc-with-eclipse-kl25z-part-1/)

If there's an issue, or any improvements can be made, report it in the [issues](https://github.com/0xc0170/mbed_gcc_makefile/issues).

EnjoY!
